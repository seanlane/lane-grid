A theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based on the [Hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme. This was hacked together for my own personal needs, and you're probably better off using the parent theme for your own extensions. I don't anticipate this being widely used by others.

## Quick Start

1. Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule, `git submodule add https://github.com/seanlane/lane-grid.git themes/lane-grid`.
2. Configure your `config.toml` or `config.yaml`.
3. Build your site with `hugo serve` and see the result at `http://localhost:1313/`.
